# Pharma-RL: Reinforcement Learning for De Novo Drug Discovery 💊🧪

Welcome to Pharma-RL, a groundbreaking project that harnesses the power of **reinforcement learning (RL)** to revolutionize de novo drug discovery. By framing molecular design as a game, an AI agent is trained to construct novel drug molecules from the ground up, one atom at a time. This project aims to navigate the vast and complex chemical space efficiently, seeking out molecules with specific, desirable properties such as high binding affinity, low toxicity, and ease of synthesis.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Intelligent Molecule Generation:** An RL agent learns to "play a game" of molecular construction, making intelligent decisions on how to add or modify atoms and bonds.
-   **Tailored Feedback Mechanism:** A sophisticated property prediction model acts as a **dynamic reward function**, guiding the agent's exploration towards molecules that satisfy a predefined set of criteria.
-   **Molecular Representation:** Utilizes a specialized deep learning model, such as a **graph neural network (GNN)**, to create rich molecular embeddings that serve as the state representation for the RL agent.
-   **Transparent and Decentralized Ledger:** Integrates the Solana blockchain to provide a transparent and immutable log of successful drug candidates and their properties.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### Reinforcement Learning Framework

The heart of Pharma-RL is a deep RL agent.
-   **State:** The current molecular structure, represented by a specialized molecular embedding.
-   **Actions:** Discrete chemical operations such as adding an atom, creating a bond, or modifying an existing bond.
-   **Reward:** A scalar value provided by the property prediction model, rewarding the agent for generating molecules with desired characteristics.

### Molecular Embeddings

To effectively represent a molecule's structure for the RL agent, we use a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**. A GNN processes the molecule's atoms and bonds as nodes and edges in a graph, producing a vector-based embedding that captures the molecule's structural and chemical properties.

### Property Prediction & Feedback Loop

The reward function is not static; it is powered by a machine learning model that predicts crucial molecular properties. This could include models for:
-   Target protein binding affinity
-   Toxicity
-   Solubility
-   Synthesizability

The predictions from this model serve as the "reward signal," steering the RL agent toward promising regions of the chemical space.

### Decentralized Logging with Solana

To ensure transparency and create a verifiable record of our findings, we use the **Solana blockchain**. Each time the RL agent discovers a molecule that meets the success criteria, its structure and key properties are logged as a transaction on the Solana ledger.
